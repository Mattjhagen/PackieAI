  <h1>PacMac Mobile LLC – Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: August&nbsp;11,&nbsp;2025</em></p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
  <p>
    By accessing or using the PacMac Mobile website (pacmacmobile.com) or any related
    services—including device purchases, trade‑in programs, lease‑to‑own offerings, and
    home/travel internet subscriptions (collectively, the “Services”)—you agree to be
    bound by these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree to these Terms, please
    do not use our Services. The Terms constitute a binding agreement between PacMac
    Mobile LLC (“PacMac,” “we,” or “us”) and you, the user or customer (“you” or
    “your”).

  <h2>2. Description of Services</h2>
  <p>
    PacMac provides an online storefront for purchasing new devices, arranging trade‑ins
    through our partner Phobio, applying for lease‑to‑own financing through Progressive
    Leasing, initiating Apple‑authorized trade‑ins and repairs, and ordering wireless
    internet plans via Nomad Internet. When you engage with third‑party services through
    our website, those partners may have their own terms of service or policies; you are
    responsible for reviewing and agreeing to them. We are not responsible for the
    content or policies of those third‑party services.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Use of the Site</h2>
  <p>You agree to use the Services for lawful purposes only and in accordance with these Terms.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Uploading or transmitting any obscene, abusive, or illegal content.</li>
    <li>Violating any applicable laws or regulations.</li>
    <li>Hacking, introducing viruses, or tampering with our website.</li>
    <li>Using bots or automated scripts to access or interact with our Services.</li>
    <li>Interfering with other users’ use or enjoyment of the Services.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to terminate or restrict your access if you engage in prohibited
    activities or otherwise violate these Terms.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Account Creation and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Some Services may require you to create an account. You agree to provide accurate,
    current, and complete information and to update such information as necessary. You
    are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and
    for any activities that occur under your account. You agree to notify us immediately
    of any unauthorized use of your account.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Products and Pricing</h2>
  <p>
    Prices and product descriptions are subject to change without notice. Although we
    strive to ensure that the information on our website is accurate, errors,
    inaccuracies, or omissions may occur. We reserve the right to correct any errors
    and to change or update information or cancel orders if any information on the site
    is inaccurate at any time without prior notice. Pricing and payment terms may vary
    for lease‑to‑own transactions or trade‑ins; you agree to abide by the specific
    payment terms provided during checkout.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Payments</h2>
  <p>
    We accept various payment methods as displayed during checkout. By submitting
    payment information, you represent and warrant that you have the legal right to use
    any payment method(s) utilized. For lease‑to‑own arrangements through Progressive
    Leasing, you will enter into a separate lease agreement with the provider and may be
    subject to additional terms and credit approvals.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Trade‑In Programs</h2>
  <p>
    If you trade in a device through our partner Phobio or Apple’s authorized trade‑in
    program, you agree to provide truthful information about the device’s model,
    condition, and ownership. Trade‑in values are estimates and may change after
    inspection. You acknowledge that your trade‑in device becomes the property of the
    trade‑in partner upon acceptance and that you relinquish any claims to the device or
    its contents once it is received.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Lease‑to‑Own Financing</h2>
  <p>
    Lease‑to‑own financing is offered by Progressive Leasing or other third‑party
    providers. PacMac does not make credit decisions; eligibility, payment schedules,
    and final purchase options are determined by the provider. By choosing this
    option, you consent to share necessary personal information with the financing
    provider for credit evaluation.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Nomad Internet Plans</h2>
  <p>
    Orders for home or travel internet plans are fulfilled by Nomad Internet. Coverage
    and service availability depend on your location. You agree to provide accurate
    information (e.g., ZIP code) for availability checks and to comply with Nomad’s
    terms and conditions. PacMac is not liable for service outages or performance
    issues related to third‑party network providers.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Returns and Refunds</h2>
  <p>
    All device sales are final unless otherwise stated in a specific return policy. If a
    product is damaged during shipping or arrives defective, please contact us within
    7&nbsp;days of receipt to arrange a repair, replacement, or credit. Trade‑in transactions
    and lease payments are non‑refundable. We reserve the right to refuse returns or
    exchanges that do not meet our criteria.
  </p>

  <p>
    We ship orders to valid addresses within the United States. Shipping times are
    estimates and may vary due to carrier delays or supply constraints. We are not
    liable for delays or losses caused by carriers or events beyond our control.

    to the Services shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Omaha, Nebraska,
    unless you opt to pursue claims in small claims court. You waive any right to
    participate in a class action.
  </p>

  <h2>18. Changes to the Terms</h2>
  <p>
    We may modify these Terms at any time. If we make material changes, we will post
    the updated Terms with a new “Last updated” date and, when possible, provide
    notice via email or the Services. Your continued use of the Services after changes
    are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.
